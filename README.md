## What?
CRYPT is a tool that allows you to encrypt or decrypt texts.

## Why?
The main reason I wrote this program was having access to common encodings and hash
functions in one place. Later I added more functions and ciphers. All releases have
a script named `CryptB.py` which takes 2 files as input and output and encodes or
decodes the input file line by line while writing to output file.

## What encodings, ciphers, and hashes are supported?
1. Encodings:
   - Base16
   - Base32
   - Base64
   - Base85

2. Ciphers:
   - Caesar Cipher
   - Morse Code
   - Baconian Cipher
   - Vigen√®re Cipher

3. Hashes:
   - MD5
   - Md5 Crypt
   - SHA256 & SHA512
   - SHA256 & SHA512 Crypt
   - NT
   - BCrypt
   - Argon2
   - PBKDF2+SHA256 & PBKDF2+SHA512
   - Hash Cracking with a wordlist or by Bruteforcing

## Usage
Run main app using
```shell
python Crypt-?.?.?.py
```
or
```shell
./Crypt-?.?.?.py
```
Where `?.?.?` is the version.

---

Running `CryptB.py` is same way as above, except that `CryptB.py` is a CLI tool
and accept arguments and options.
You can see all options for `CryptB.py` using `--help` option:

```shell
./CryptB.py --help
```

```
Usage: CryptB.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -F, --file FILENAME             File containing plain text for encryption.
  -O, --out PATH                  Path/File to write the encrypted text to.
  -M, --method [md5|md5-brute|...|baconian-e|baconian-d]
                                  Method to use for encryption.
  -K, --key INTEGER               Encryption/decryption key for ciphers that support it.
                                  Positive integer for encryption, Negative
                                  integer for decryption.
  --about, --copyright            Show About & Copyright
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```
